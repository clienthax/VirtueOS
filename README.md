Open-source community OldSchool RuneScape Private Server with Client loader project.

### How do I get set up? ###
* Import Gradle project.
* Compile with Java 1.8+
* Execute com.oldscape.server.Main.main()

If NOT using RuneLite runescape-client 1.3.5 (com.oldscape.client.reference)
* Execute com.oldscape.client.asm.Application.main()

>This will transform the standard revision 168 gamepack.jar from ./repository/applet/ to connect to our server.
Though this will be used mainly for Players.

* Execute com.oldscape.client.applet.GameApplet.main()
