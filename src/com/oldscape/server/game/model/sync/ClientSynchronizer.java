 * The {@link ClientSynchronizer} manages the update sequence which keeps

 * distributed with Apollo: {@link SequentialClientSynchronizer} which is
 * optimized for a single-core/single-processor machine and
 * {@link ParallelClientSynchronizer} which is optimized for a multi-processor/
 * multi-core machines.
 * <p>
 * To switch between the two synchronizer implementations, edit the
 * {@code synchronizers.xml} configuration file. The default implementation is
 * currently {@link ParallelClientSynchronizer} as the vast majority of machines
 * today have two or more cores.
